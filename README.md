### Creating Static Pages with UI Components

If you want to create a new page in the top level of the website (nodebench.com/<this_level>), There are serveral components available that
may help to format the page correctly.

The "@/components/ui/static-pages" file provides Main, Paragraph, Subtitle, Title components which are wrappers over existing standard HTML components with applied styles and proper formatting guidelines.

- Main - Wraps the whole page with a main tag with container tags and applied padding and margins. You should wrap your top-level pages with this component. Props: children and className.
- Title - Used for title of the page, displayed at the top after the nav. This is the main title. Should be ideally used once in the page. title prop is required.
- Subtitle - Any other title or heading on the page other than the main title. title prop is required.
- Paragraph - Any body of text. Wraps a p tag. props: children and className.

Here is a example page (/contact) that shows how to use these components:

```jsx
import { Main, Title, Subtitle, Paragraph } from "@/components/ui/static-pages";

export default function ContactPage() {
  <Main>
    <Title title="Contact Us" />
    <Paragraph className="mb-10">
      Have a burning tech question, want to discuss a hardware project, or just
      geek out about computers? I&apos;m all ears!
    </Paragraph>
    <Subtitle title="Email" />
    <Paragraph>Please mail us at our official mail id.</Paragraph>

    <Subtitle title="Social Media" />
    <Paragraph>
      You can also reach out to us on our social media handles.
    </Paragraph>
  </Main>;
}
```

### Style Guide

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You can find the Tailwind CSS style guide [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

Here are some additional guidelines:

#### Cards
![Card Example](docs/images/cards.png)
The background of the cards is gray-200. The padding is 4.


## Articles

The articles are written in Markdown but you are free to use any valid JSX in the markdown file. The articles are in the app/(app)/articles/ directory. Each article has its own directory with a page.mdx file, you can create this file using the `npm run new-article` command. This command will also create a image folder in the public/articles directory with the same name as the article directory. You should put all images you want to use in page.mdx file here.

There are some components which are automatically added in the page.mdx file.

- Next.js Metadata - This is the standard metadata for the page. This is also used for creating metadata for articles in the public/data/articles.json file.

- articleInfo - This is the metadata for the article. This is used to create the article card in the homepage. It takes the following props:
  - type - The type of the article. This is used to filter the articles in the homepage. There are two types, 'blog' and 'article'. This is used to filter articles for search and other pages.
  - thumbnail - The thumbnail of the article.

- Topbar - This component is used to display the topbar of the article. It takes the following props:
  - thumbnail - The thumbnail of the article.
  - title - The title of the article.
  - author - The author of the article.
  - date - The date of the article.

- Content - This is the main content wrapper. It wraps the MainContent and Tldr components. This is mainly for layout purposes.
  - MainContent - This is the main content of the article. This is where you should put the main content of the article.
  - Tldr - This is the TLDR of the article. This is displayed along side the main content in the article card. This component also has links and cards for other articles and reviews.

- AuthorCard - This is the author card of the article. It takes the following props:
  - authorSlug - The slug of the author. The author data is defined in app\(app)\articles\_components\Content.tsx
