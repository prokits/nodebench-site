Find the best laptop under ₹40,000 for your needs, these are our recommendations for each category.

### What is the bare minimum specifications required?

When shopping for a laptop in this price range, here are the minimum specifications you should look for:

- **RAM**: At least 8 GB of RAM is essential for smooth multitasking and running modern applications. While 4 GB might work for very basic tasks, it will feel sluggish with multiple browser tabs or applications open.

- **Processor**: Look for at least a 12th gen Intel Core i3 or AMD Ryzen 3 5000 series. These modern processors provide good performance for everyday computing tasks.

- **Storage**: A minimum 256 GB SSD is recommended over traditional hard drives. SSDs provide much faster boot times and application loading speeds. Avoid laptops with only HDDs if possible.

- **Display**: Full HD (1920x1080) resolution should be the minimum for a comfortable viewing experience.

- **Battery**: Look for at least a 40 Whr battery which should provide 4-5 hours of regular use. Larger batteries are better if portability is important to you.

These specifications will ensure your laptop remains usable for the next few years and can handle common tasks like web browsing, document editing, and light multitasking without frustrating slowdowns.

# Best All Rounder

## Acer Aspire 3

This comes with Intel Core i5 1235U, 16 GB of DDR4 RAM and 1 TB NVMe SSD, which is more than sufficient for everyday tasks and even light casual gaming. It has a 14" IPS Full HD display with 45% NTSC color gamut, the color accuracy is not great but you can't complain at this price point. This laptop weighs 1.45 Kg. It comes with Wi-Fi 6 and Backlit Keyboard.

This is a solid contender for the best laptop under this price point and if I have to recommend one a single laptop this would be it.

## Dell Inspiron 3530

It comes with a 13th gen Intel Core i3 1205U processor with 8GB DDR4 RAM and a 512GB NVMe SSD. The display is 15.6" Full HD 120Hz which is quite surprising at this price point. It weighs 1.62 Kg. It has a 41 watt hour battery.

If your budget is a on a little lower side then you should go with this laptop, at the price bracket of ₹35,000 this is a no brainer.

## MSI Modern 14

The MSI Modern 14 comes with a 12th gen i5 1235U processor with 16 GB DDR4 RAM and 512 GB NVMe SSD. The display is 14" Full HD display. It weighs about 1.4Kg. It comes with a backlit keyboard and in our opinion this is the best looking laptop in this list.

This is a good laptop in this price range. The only problem being is that MSI does not offer on site warranties.
