Nvidia announced its RTX 5000 range at CES this week. We have 4 models announced and RTX 5070 seems too good to be true. The GPUs are said to be released in this month i.e. January. People are in awe of the performance promised by Nvidia during the announcement and Jensen is looking more confident than he has looked in years.

We are going to went over each GPU one by one.

# RTX 5090

If everything goes well this is going to be the best gaming GPU when it launches, considering the fact that AMD will not release any flagship GPUs anymore. This GPU is much more powerful than the current beast 4090. This GPU comes with a massive 32GB of GDDR7 VRAM with 21,760 CUDA cores.

Nvidia also announced DLSS4, which supports Multi Frame Gen resulting in even more frames than previously possible. In games that support this feature, Nvidia says you’ll be able to play games at 4K with a frame rate of 240fps. The 5090’s VRAM is attached via a super-wide 512-bit memory interface, resulting in enormous memory bandwidth, about 1,792GB/s to be precise. The rated power consumption is at 575W, 125W more than the 450W that 4090 was rated for. 5090 requires a single 12VHPWR connector for its power requirements.

# RTX 5080

The RTX 5080 is the second most powerful GPU in the lineup. It has 10,752 CUDA cores, half the memory at 16GB with a 256-bit memory bus. It has a significantly lower power draw of 360W.

# RTX 5070 Ti

There was not much talk about this card in particular but this card. This comes with 8960 CUDA cores, 16GB of VRAM with a 256-bit bus and a power draw of 300W.

# RTX 5070

The main headline of the even was Nvidia saying that the RTX 5070 is just as fast as the RTX 4090. Many people were skeptical of this claim. However, we should note that the 5000 series GPU support DLSS4, which is much superior in frame generation. If we were to compare the real raw GPU compute performance it would be closer to compare 5070 to the 4080. Still its very good for a GPU of this price bracket.

The RTX 5070 has 6,144 CUDA cores, 12GB VRAM with a 192-bit bus and a power draw of 250W. Some people was sad to still see that the 5070 has the same amount of VRAM as the RTX 4070 today.

# The Pricing

The cheapest among the 5000 series is the 5070 with a starting price of $549, around ₹48,000. At this price this is going to be the best card available when it launches. Next is the RTX 5070 Ti for $ 749, around ₹65,000. RTX 5080 for $999, around ₹87,000 and finally the all mighty RTX 5090 for $1,999 which is around ₹1,74,000. For context the RTX 4090 was launched for $1,599, the RTX 5090 is launched for 25% more than the previous generation launch prices.
