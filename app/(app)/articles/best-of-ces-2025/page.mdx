CES 2025 just ended and there was a lot to unpack from the event. From electric spoons to humanoid robots, we have got everything this year. Nvidia announced its 5000 series GPUs and I am very excited for what’s to come. Here are my top picks from the CES floor this year. In no particular order.

# Robot vacuum with an arm

If you have a robotic vacuum, you must like the comfort it provides, you set it up once and your floor is cleaned. But what if there are say for example socks on the floor, Roborock has a solution, a robot vacuum with a arm. This arm can grab and place objects, this can pick up obstacles that it comes across while cleaning. This is a great addition to the robot vacuum.

The weight limit for the arm is about 230 grams. Roborock Saros Z70's is set to debut during the first half of 2025.

# Lenovo rollable laptop

This 14 inch laptop can extend its display to 16 inches, boosting your productivity on the go. On the press of a button you could go from a small display to a larger, longer display. You could now fit extra long spreadsheets on your screen comfortably.

The ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 is said to be available in June for a eye watering $3499.

# Electric spoon that helps you taste salt

The Kirin Electric Salt Spoon allows you to taste spoon without adding more sodium to your diet. The spoon is covered with conductors that used some form of electric current to simulate your taste buds when you take this spoon in your mouth. Pretty cool.

# Displace TV

Displace TV is a battery powered TV that comes with suction cups that you can mount anywhere. If you are constantly shifting places and homes this could be very appeling to you. The Displace TV comes with 4 suction cups that it uses to stick to any wall surface and it runs on battery, so you could use it pretty much anywhere. It comes in varying sizes, starting with a $1,499 27-inch model and going up to a $4,999 55-inch TV, which will ship in spring 2025.

# Honda 0 series EVs

This was also seen last year but this year it looks more like a final version than just a concept. The EV is said to go into production in 2026. It looks sleek and gorgeous. There are curves in the right location and sharp edges in the front. It is running Honda’s Asimo OS. The price of the Honda 0 Series is expected to start around $50,000.


# Conclusion
This year there was some great products and innovative technology shown at CES 2025. From practical solutions like the Roborock Saros Z70 to futuristic concepts like the electric salt spoon, this year's show demonstrated how technology continues to evolve to meet our everyday needs. I'm particularly excited to see how these products will perform once they hit the market.
