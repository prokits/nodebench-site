                    Hey there! I&apos;m Tushar - by day, a web technologist at Orangewood Labs, by night, a hardware hacker with an obsession for Raspberry Pis and an unhealthy love affair with 3D printers. When most people unwind with Netflix, I&apos;m soldering circuits and benchmarking single board computers. NodeBench is basically my digital playground where I get to turn my tech addiction into something useful (or at least, that&apos;s what I tell myself). Expect honest reviews, geeky insights, and the occasional dad joke about microcontrollers.
